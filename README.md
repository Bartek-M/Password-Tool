# Password Tool
Simple tool for **generating**, **validating** and **hashing** passwords. It was made using **Golang** with built-in libraries. This is my first **Go** project.

> If you find any bugs, feel free to create a new **issue** in this repository.

## Requirements
- Golang 1.22.1 or above 

## Setup
Once you have Go installed, run

```bash
go run main.go
```

This will only run the script, if you want to have an executable application, run

```bash
go build .
```
